    <h3> I'm a 5th year Communications student at the University of Georgia in pursuit of the New Media Certificate. I am currently a sister of Delta Phi Lambda Sorority, Inc. and I work at the Zell. B Miller Learning Center as a EITS Student Consultant. For my 22nd birthday, I received a special blessing. Her name is Latte. She is my very own special puppy and she is most definitely a handful. The first few months with her were definitely hectic and stressful but over time things got a little better. Now she's still sassy as ever, but she is my special baby. In my spare time I enjoy taking photos and cooking. I've taken many graduation photoshoots as well as sorority chapter shoots. When I'm not taking pictures of people, I am in the kitchen cooking up a storm. I enjoy cooking things like asian food to italian. I also love baking as well. My favorite thing to bake are creampuffs and creme brulee. When I'm not in the kitchen, I love binge wathching show such as the Flash and Riverdale. A current show that I'm very into at the moment is Rizzoli and Isles. It's about a dectective and a chief medical examiner and the series is filled with sass and action. </h3>
