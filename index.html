<p class="sidebar"> Favorite Creme Brulee Recipe:
    <br/>
½ cup  unsalted butter, 1 stick
    <br/>
½ cup  water
    <br/>
½ cup  milk
    <br/>
3 tablespoons  granulated sugar
    <br/>
1 teaspoon  salt
    <br/>
1 cup  all-purpose flour
    <br/>
4 large eggs
    <br/>
1 egg, beaten, for egg wash
    <br/>
2 cups  heavy cream
    <br/>
3 tablespoons  powdered sugar
    <br/>
1 teaspoon  vanilla extract    
<br/>
 Preheat the oven to 425F (220C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Chill a large bowl in the freezer.
    <br/>
Make the puffs: in a medium pot, bring the butter, water, milk, sugar, and salt to a boil over high heat.
    <br/>
Once the liquid begins to boil, remove the pot from the heat and immediately add the flour, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon until the liquid is absorbed and the mixture begins to form a ball.
    <br/>
Return the pot to the heat and cook for another 30 seconds to remove excess moisture. Remove the pot from the heat. Working quickly, add the eggs one at a time, stirring until each one is fully incorporated before adding the next. Continue stirring until the dough starts to pull away from the sides of the pan and is thick and glossy. Transfer the batter to a piping bag or zip-top bag fitted with a round tip.
    <br/>
Pipe 1-inch (2-cm) dollops of batter on the prepared baking sheet, spacing them at least 1-inch (2-cm) apart.
    <br/>
Dip a fingertip in the egg wash and gently press down any points, then brush the egg wash lightly all over the puffs.
    <br/>
Bake for 10 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350F (180C), and continue to bake for 20 minutes more, until golden brown.
    <br/>
Transfer the puffs to a wire rack and cool until able to handle. Cut the tops off of the puffs with a serrated knife. Let cool completely.
    <br/>
Make the whipped cream: add the heavy cream and powdered sugar to the chilled bowl and beat with an electric hand mixer or whisk until stiff peaks form. Transfer the whipped cream to a piping bag or zip-top bag fitted with a round tip.
    <br/>
Pipe mounds of whipped cream into the puffs. Add the tops of the puffs.
    <br/>
Enjoy!

This is my recreation of the creampuffs. I made quite a few mistakes but over all these creampuffs turned out pretty good. Instaed of using whipped cream for the filling, I made a choux pastry. Choux pastry is more of a custard and it is very creamy and rich. I would highly suggest you try out making these at home! It takes a little elbow grease, but overall very worth the trouble.
